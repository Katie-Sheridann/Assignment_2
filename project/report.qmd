## Introduction 
[***HIV and WASH***]{style="color:darkred;"} are closely related, and this interaction has a significant impact on [***child mortality rates***]{style="color:darkred;"}, especially for children under the age of five. In many places, poor access to hygienic practices, clean water, and sanitary facilities not only increases the likelihood of HIV/AIDS infection and spread but also exacerbates the transmission. This nexus underscores how [***critical***]{style="color:darkred;"} it is to develop integrated [***strategies***]{style="color:darkred;"} that address HIV prevention and treatment tactics in addition to WASH-related issues to mitigate the devastating impact on [***child health and survival***]{style="color:darkred;"}.


Below I have mentioned the different data I will be using throughout this report:

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}

- Proportion of population using improved sanitation facilities.
- Reported number of pregnant women presenting at antenatal clinics (ANC)     who were tested for HIV or already knew their HIV positive status.
- Mother-to-child HIV transmission rate.
- Deaths caused by diarrhea in 2021.
- Under-five mortality rate.
- Average Life expectancy from 1960 to 2022.

People usually practise [***open defecation***]{style="color:darkred;"} or riverbank dumping when they [***lack access***]{style="color:darkred;"} to sanitation. In order to guarantee that individuals living with HIV (PLHIV) lead healthy and fulfilling lives, [***WASH is crucial***]{style="color:darkred;"}.

<br>
Typhoid and skin infections are among the WASH-related ailments that people living with HIV are more prone to. Additionally, those who have HIV are [***six times more likely to get diarrheal illness***]{style="color:darkred;"}; 90% of those who have HIV have experienced diarrhoea at least once.(STOPAIDS., 2013)

## Child mortality

As a result of their weakened immune systems, infants exposed to HIV are more susceptible to diseases like diarrhea. [***'Babies born to mothers living with HIV are three times more likely to have diarrhea.'***]{style="color:darkred;"}(STOPAIDS., 2013). In regions where there is a limited access to healthcare and clean water infants exposed to HIV face a higher risk of diarrheal diseases, which [***raises the death rate of children under five by a substantial margin.***]{style="color:darkred;"}
```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Above we can see from the scatter plot that there is a positive correlation between % deaths caused by diarrhoea and child mortality rate under 5.

## Transmission 
[***Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT)***]{style="color:darkred;"} of HIV occurs when an HIV-positive mother passes the virus to her [***child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding.***]{style="color:darkred;"} The risk of MTCT can range from [***15 to 45%***]{style="color:darkred;"} in the absence of treatment.This means that without medical intervention, nearly half of the infants born to HIV-positive mothers may acquire the virus. But the risk can be brought down to [***less than 5%***]{style="color:darkred;"} with the right measures including [***antiretroviral therapy (ART).***]{style="color:darkred;"}

A population's health and well-being can be determined by looking at important indicators such as the infant mortality rate and life expectancy at birth. 

<br>
[***Greater life expectancy***]{style="color:darkred;"} at birth and lower infant mortality rates are signs of [*improved nutrition, hygiene, healthcare facilities, and general socioeconomic development in a community.*]{.underline}

From the time series graph below, we can see that [***life expectancy has increased between 1960 and 2022***]{style="color:darkred;"} in this sample of countries, with major advances linked to improvements in living standards and healthcare. But trends in life expectancy have been [***significantly impacted by the HIV/AIDS pandemic***]{style="color:darkred;"}, especially in the hardest-hit areas.While high-income countries with better access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) have seen improvements, low-income countries continue to face challenges in addressing HIV transmission and its associated impacts on life expectancy. [***Disparities still exist***]{style="color:darkred;"} despite advancements in HIV treatment and prevention, underscoring the necessity of ongoing [***global healthcare system strengthening initiatives***]{style="color:darkred;"} and HIV/AIDS preventive efforts to [***extend life expectancy and enhance overall well-being.***]{style="color:darkred;"}

## Conclusion 
As we can see from the data throughout this report child mortality is greatly impacted by the relationship between HIV and WASH, particularly in [***sub-Saharan Africa***]{style="color:darkred;"} where there is [***inadequate access to clean water and sanitation***]{style="color:darkred;"}, which [***exacerbates HIV transmission***]{style="color:darkred;"} and related illnesses. Given the increased risk of HIV infection in infants born to women who are positive for the virus, antiretroviral medication is an important form of intervention. The HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to impact the hardest-hit communities despite gains in life expectancy worldwide since 1960. This highlights the need for [***integrated efforts***]{style="color:darkred;"} to address HIV, WASH, and child health challenges.
